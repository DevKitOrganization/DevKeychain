## Development Requirements

DevKeychain requires a Swift 6.1 toolchain to build. We only test on Apple platforms. We follow
the [Swift API Design Guidelines][SwiftAPIDesignGuidelines]. We take pride in the fact that our
public interfaces are fully documented and tested. We aim for overall test coverage over 99%.
